# Chromatic Polynomial Calculation

## Introduction
This program calculates the chromatic polynomial $\chi_G$ of a graph $G$ using recursion. The value $\chi_G(x)$ is the number of those colorings of the vertices of $G$ using $x$ colors, for which no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

### The program performs the following:
1. Input a connected graph in the form a set of edges
2. Computes the chromatic polynomial for a constructed graph.
3. Outputs the result as a polynomial expression.
